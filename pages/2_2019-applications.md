### Workshop participants
The application for the workshop is closed! We selected 120 participants and they have all been contacted. Please note that we can no longer accommodate more people!


### Workshop information
The two-week long workshop will introduce you to the Python programming language through a hands-on approach focused on problem-solving. The course covers all of the fundamental constructs of Python and is aimed at beginner programmers. The materials have been chosen because they are fundamental to Python, but also because they are fundamental to many other programming languages and thus, after having completed this course, we expect students to be capable to learn other programming languages on their own. Being able to be a self-reliant learner is a skill and, like all skills, it must be practiced. However, it can also be very time consuming to attempt to learn anything without guidance; for this reason we have compiled several problems which we shall use to build your programming confidence.

### Tutors
The following are the PWSA2019 tutors -- they enjoy programming and they are passionate about helping others learn it. The first five people are PhD students from the School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, while the last two people are from the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. They participated in PWSA2018, and we hope to train them during PWSA2019, so that they can go on to train others in their University effectively.
