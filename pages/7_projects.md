# Projects

At the end of the workshop, we're not going to teach you anything new. What's the point in cramming more in if you're never given the chance to solve interesting problems with what you know?

Tom, Ben and Sofiat have put together three projects to test your understanding of Python, and to give you some lovely meaty problems that should be fun to work on.

## Designing and implementing your own language
<!-- Tom's project description -->

It's nice to be able to write Python, but programming languages actually aren't that special. Tom's absolutely fascinated by programming languages, and he solved this problem when *he* was learning Python, and he thinks you can, too.

The problem is to take a simple programming language, and to implement it, so that you can *write and run your own programs*. You'll come away with a deeper understanding of what programming is and what programming languages are, and a feeling for what the less-mathematical kind of computer science can be like!

You can find Tom's project in your `pwsafrica/pwsafrica_projects` folder, or [download it here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/language_project.pdf)!



## Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computation
<!-- Ben's project description -->




You can find Ben's project in your `pwsafrica/pwsafrica_projects` folder, or [download it here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/modelling_project.pdf)!



## Matching Corp Members in the NYSC
