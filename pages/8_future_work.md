We've had a fantastic time at PWSAfrica 2018! Thanks so much for having us in your beautiful country. 

We've put together one final piece of materials: a Jupyter Notebook containing advice, useful libraries and websites, and a bunch more problems to solve. We hope that, in using it, you'll find you can actually teach yourself some Python now that you know the basics.

[You can download the notebook here.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/future_work.ipynb) If you have questions, remember you can email and ask.

Thanks so much for attending the workshop!
