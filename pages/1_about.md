## Our goal
Our goal is to empower scientists at the University level in Africa with the computer programming tools needed to drive innovative research. We hope to achieve this by delivering an annual programming workshop, expanding to different Universities. In recognition of this initiative, [Sofiat Olaosebikan](http://dcs.gla.ac.uk/~sofiat) was named as one of the [Future World Changers](https://www.gla.ac.uk/study/studentlife/worldchangers/future/sofiat) at the University of Glasgow.

## Previous workshops
With support from the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/internationalpartners/internationaloutreach/) at the University of Glasgow, we started off our workshop series in 2018 at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, delivering a two-week training which focused on the fundamental concepts of Python programming for mathematical sciences. In 2019, we ran a similar workshop at the University of Rwanda, Kigali, where we focused on the fundamentals of Python programming for scientific purposes. So far, approximately 200 African scientists have benefitted from our training.

#### Would you like for us to come run a similar workshop at your University next year? Please email the team at <emph> pwsafrica@gmail.com, so that you will get notified when the application to host process opens</emph>.
