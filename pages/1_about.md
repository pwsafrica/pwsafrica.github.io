## Our goal
Our goal is to empower scientists at the University level in Africa with the computer programming tools needed to drive innovative research. We hope to achieve this by delivering an annual programming workshop, expanding to different Universities. In recognition of this initiative, [Sofiat Olaosebikan](http://dcs.gla.ac.uk/~sofiat) was named as one of the [Future World Changers](https://www.gla.ac.uk/study/studentlife/worldchangers/future/sofiat) at the University of Glasgow.

## Previous workshops
With [support](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/internationalpartners/internationaloutreach/) from the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow, we started off our workshop series in 2018 at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, delivering a two-week training which focused on the fundamental concepts of Python programming for mathematical sciences.

## This year
This year we are looking to run another workshop, this time at the University of Rwanda, Kigali.  We will again focus on delivering a course which teaches the fundamentals of Python programming for scientific purposes.

Would you like for us to come run a similar workshop at your University next year? Please email the team at <emph> pwsafrica@gmail.com</emph>.
