## Our goal
Our goal is to empower scientists at the University level in Africa with the programming tools needed to drive innovative research. We hope to achieve this by delivering an annual programming workshop, expanding to different Universities.

## This year
With support from the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/internationalpartners/internationaloutreach/) at the University of Glasgow, we are looking to start off at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, delivering a two-week training which focuses on the fundamental concepts of Python programming for mathematical sciences.

If you would like for us to come run a similar workshop at your University next year, please email <emph> pwsafrica@gmail.com</emph>.
