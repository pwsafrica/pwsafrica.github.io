All workshop participants, tutors and instructors are required to agree with the following code of conduct. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe learning environment for everybody. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the workshop. 

## The Code of Conduct

Our aim is to provide a harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of  gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. All communication should be appropriate for a general audience, which will include people from different backgrounds. In general, the workshop will not tolerate:
<ul>
<li> harassment of participants in any form, </li>
<li> sexual language and imagery throughout the two-week training, </li>
<li> insulting or unpleasant language or behaviour. </li>
</ul>

Any participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the workshop.

If you sense any distress or believe another participant is being abused, please speak to one of the tutors immediately. We will make sure your identity is not disclosed, we will take your report seriously, investigate promptly, and if necessary take appropriate action.
