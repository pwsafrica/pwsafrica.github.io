## Workshop information
 
The workshop will cover an intensive two-week long curriculum designed to train participants on the essential programming skills needed for mathematical sciences. This will include variables, data types, data structures, loops, branching, functions, recursions, data handling, and usage of libraries (e.g., numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.) for mathematical computations and plotting, using the **Python programming language**. The format of the workshop will involve lectures and a lot of practical sessions, supported by a team of tutors. The workshop will also aim to give mathematical concepts context and relevance by exposing the participants to real-world applications arising from research which makes use of mathematical tools and computer programming.

## Interested?
Application for participating in the workshop will soon be announced.
