###  [Sofiat Olaosebikan](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/researchstudents/sofiatolamijiolaosebikan/)
<p class="bio"> I am a second-year PhD student in the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow, with a passion for problem solving and programming. My research is focused on how we can use mathematical algorithms to find fast and accurate solutions to matching problems. Matching problems arise when we need to construct optimal allocation between sets of entities. An interesting example of matching problem in my home country is the allocation of youths to states for their National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).</p>  

<p class="bio"> 
I love to code, and I am passionate about using my skills to help people. My desire to pass on my computing knowledge to fellow scientists in my continent was what led to PWSAfrica. I am really excited and enthusiastic about this initiative, and I am very much looking forward to our first workshop in Nigeria. I can't wait to see where this journey takes me and everyone involved.</p>

### Benjamin Bumpus
<p class="bio"> I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Glasgow. I am an Italian-American with a passion for
farming, mathematics and computer science. My mathematical interests lie in combinatorics, graph theory and theoretical computer science. My PhD focuses on graph decompositions and connectivity in graphs and abstract connectivity systems. To put it plainly, I study the mathematics of "things that come in chunks", the limits we encounter when we try to solve problems involving these "chunky things" and how these chunky things can be assembled together into even chunkier structures.</p>  

<p class="bio"> 
My love for programing stems from how it connects abstract mathematical thought and concrete computation. I am excited about the PWSAfrica project because I can't wait to show other mathematicians and scientists all about the wonderful interplay between mathematical thought and its physical embodiment!

### Fatma Elsafoury
<p class="bio"> I am a final year PhD student at the University of Glasgow. I’m interested in social science computing which is the usage of computing science tools to understand human behavior and to make people’s lives better. My research is about detecting violent incidents from tweets during times of political unrest. Working on a project or PhD for a long time can be stressful at times. So, having interest in Arts and doing activities like drawing, pottery making  and screen script writing made my life easier and taught me a lot of skills. Tutoring is another activity that I enjoy and find it a good way to connect and communicate with people. </p>
<p class="bio"> Programming is a great tool; you can apply it in almost every field. That is why I am excited to be part of this workshop, to help people learn programming and to get them inspired with the great things they can do with it. </p>
