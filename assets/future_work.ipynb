    "\n",
    "Toward the end of the first week, we wrote code which produced \"Collatz sequences\". Our solutions produced lists of collatz sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For problems like this, testing small numbers is much easier than testing large numbers. For example, the series for 3 is `7` numbers long, but for `3000`, it's 49! As we get into sequences that are thousands long --- or millions! --- our computers might get a bit slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph theory can help us here. Instead of just producing a list, what if we recorded which numbers lead to others? The example we gave before on the board was the sequence for `3`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we generate the sequence for `6`, we *know* that, once we reach `3`, we'll end the sequence in exactly the same way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the sequence for `20` is similar, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this to our advantage in a clever way. If we record the number one number leads to, we only ever have to compute the next number *once*! What's more: we just have to store what *single number* comes after another number, and then use that to find *it's* next number, again and again, until we reach 1 like before. (This technique is called \"memoization\", and is related to \"dynamic programming\", if you'd like to read more after the problem. It's phenomenally effective!)\n",
    "\n",
    "So. Instead of building a collatz *sequence*, we can put together a *dictionary* representing *all* collatz sequences. The dictionary has integers for both its keys and its values, and for every key in the dictionary, the next number in the sequences will be its value. We can do this because given any number in the collatz sequence, there is exactly one number it will lead to!\n",
    "\n",
    "What we are building is a directed graph. Each relationship in the dictionary is an edge in the graph, indicating the next step of the collatz sequence. A similar graph is drawn in [xkcd #710](https://xkcd.com/710/).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your task:* Implement a Collatz function which --- like before --- will take a number and return a list representing its Collatz sequence, but which builds the sequence from a dictionary representation as soon as it can, and records every computation it makes in this dictionary for later."

    "## RPN Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "A *Reverse Polish Notation* (RPN) calculator was a popular kind of calculator in the Soviet Union. RPN calculators are also supposed to be easier for children to learn to use than regular calculators, and it turns out that writing them is quite a good exercise!\n",
    "\n",
    "A traditional calculator works using *infix notation*. This looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "6 * 4 + 6  # = 30\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "6 6 4 * +  # = 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This has some benefits. One is that it turns out to be quite easy for computers to understand! More relevant to us humans, it also turns out that you never have to specify your order of operations with RPN. For example: if I wanted to write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "6 * (4 + 6)  # = 60\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is RPN executed?!\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer takes the first operator and the last two digits, calculates the result, and leaves the result at the front of the digits. So:\n",

    "# Our tips & Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "We thought it might be helpful to make some notes here of useful Python things, and tips on how professional programmers write code, to help you out when you're teaching yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good programmers read as much code as they write\n",
    "\n",
    "In school, when we want to write an essay, we don't just write and write until we produce something we are happy with. The first step is to *read*! Indeed, the best writers spend lots of their time reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the best programmers read other people's code. This has a few benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It helps to inform your own sense of style\n",
    "* It trains you in computational thinking, because you have to learn to follow what the code *means* in your head.\n",
    "* Sometimes, when you get good at reading code, you spot ways not to do things!\n",
    "* You're constantly exposed to new ideas and ways of approaching problems\n",
    "* You become more naturally familiar with the language you are working with, *helping you to express your own ideas in that language*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good place to begin reading Python code is [Keon's repository of Python algorithms](https://github.com/keon/algorithms).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Readable code is absolutely essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't just write our code --- other people have to read it too, and *we* might have to read it if we revisit a project a few months after we've written something. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make your code readable, remember to give your variable names some names that remind you what the variable is for! \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, remember to place many comments in your code. These are useful because they can serve as reminders to yourself of why you wrote particular parts of code the way you did; they are also a great way of making your code readable to others, as they explain what's happening *inline* with the code. Markdown cells in a Jupyter notebook are another great way to achieve this!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay attention to error messages! They contain useful information: usually they contain a line number and sometimes even an arrow pointing to the *character* in your code the error occurs on. If you pay attention, you'll spot when your error is indentation, or a missing colon at the end of a loop/if statement, and all of these common errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some debugging has to happen when code *runs*, but doesn't give us the right output. If your code isn't giving you the result you expect, the best way to find out what's going on is to try to execute it by hand or in your head. Get some paper and begin writing out th steps the computer will take when it runs your code, and the way it changes the state of your variables. Also, try placing as many print statements in your code as you need. This lets you see what's happening in the machine!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: with functional code, you can avoid a lot of errors with state! For this reason, a lot of professional software engineers are beginning to use functional code as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and Google are your friends\n",
    "\n",
    "You've seen us fail to solve problems *plenty* of times over the last few weeks, and you've probably heard us say that we don't always know the answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is that --- especially in a language like Python --- there are all sorts of things a language can do, and it takes years and years to learn them all. And in that time, the language changes! (Something that tripped Tom up a lot while teaching was that all of his research uses Python 2.7; we taught Python 3.6.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, did you know that Python is a very popular language for writing web servers in? It's also used sometimes in the software that runs banks. Python is also very popular for machine learning and AI. One person can't possible learn all of these fields properly!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we want to solve a problem, many software engineers will google for hints toward solving certain problems. These can be really simple problems, like how to replace characters in a string (Python has a method for this, but it's much easier to google all of the methods you rarely use than to memorise them).\n",
    "\n",
    "[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is a *very* popular site for asking questions about code, or finding answers to the questions other people have asked too!\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you ever feel silly about googling something you think is simple, remember that [we all do the same](http://imposterroster.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use GitHub to store your code\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier: if you're interested in software engineering, GitHub works as a kind of portfolio site, which is helpful when applying for further study or jobs. [You can find GitHub here.](https://github.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Play with Object Orientation\n",
    "\n",
    "*Object orientation* is a powerful concept used frequently in professional software engineering, which Python comes with excellent built-in support for. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of object orientation is that a variable should refer not just to data, but to the *behaviour* of the data. This is something you've actually already used! For example, when we call `mystring.split()`, the `.split()` function is actually a *\"method\"* called on a string *\"object\"*. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's especially useful is that we can define our own objects! The type of an object is known as its class. We often say that a variable of a certain class is an *instance* of that class. We can define classes like so:"
